<h1>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h1>
<p>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instruction that produce
 various kinds of output.programming languages are used in computer programming to implement
 algorithms.Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.There are
 programming languages.since the early 1800s,programs have been used to direct the behavior
 of machines such as Jacquard looms,music boxes and player pianos.The programs for these
 machines did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.</p>

<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">Uses of Programming Languages</h1>
<p style="color:red;">programming languages are often revised and even combined with other
languages over time, evolving to meet our changing technological needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>python is an open-source programming language used by software engineers and back-end
 Web developers.python is well suited for scientific computing, and it is relatively simple
 to learn.</li>
<li>Java is prevalent in Web-based development,and it was created in 1995.Many companies in the
 health sciences,education, and finance industries use java.java enables the downloading of
 applets from websites,which enable browsers to perform additional functions.</li>
<li>HTML is used extensively in web development.HTML is the code that serves as the foundation
 of webpages,allowing people to create and structure electronic documents for viewing online</li>
<li>Javascript is used by web developers and software engineers to manipulate page elements to
 make them more engaging.</li>
<li>C is a middle-level programming language used by software developers and system analysts.
 programmers use c to create applications that integrate with operating systems.</li>
<li>C# is a programming language used by software engineers who create applications designed
 to work with windows operating systems.</li>
<li>Developers use PHP as an open-source language to create dynamic web pages</li>
<li>SQL enables programmers to create,read,update and delete information in a database.</li>
</ul>
